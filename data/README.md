# Data

The data used in this project was sourced from the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) and [Natural Earth](https://github.com/martynafford/natural-earth-geojson/tree/master/10m/physical).

This data is combined using [utils/data_maker.py](https://github.com/lmco/lm-mit-momentum22/blob/main/utils/data_maker.py) into a single file containing waterbodies in the continental US.
